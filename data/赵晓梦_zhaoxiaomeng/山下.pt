title:山下
date:20181229

从黑暗到明亮。如果近距离凝视
你会明白，那些昂仰着头颅的葵花
其实并不需要阳光。因为一片草的约定
它们从未缺失，六月你必经的路旁

谁可以告诉我，这里的一切都曾尝试
屈向丛林的台阶，屈向刺进天空的阁楼
成为一种向上攀登的方式
但它就在那里，在你的一瞥里

就像门板对光线充满畏惧
你的现身让溪涧在桥的跨度里
有了一个完整的段落。不用回头
雾霭中的河流，带不走满城的云霞

必须承认，晨钟和暮鼓遗忘了青城
一阵微风，棉花的手指，让密林下的
山体，有了一颗玻璃心
在每一次走近，都让我看到山的众神

沉默，寂静，呼喊或者回答
都在山下的泥土持续生长
桢楠拒绝复制荆棘疼痛的尖叫
却无力摆脱宫殿致命的索取

因为有洞穴，才有了山的修行
这些道友，并不需要登临山巅
一炷清香一轮明月，都能让他们
在半路上截住你身体的疾病

一座城的人，都为这座山骄傲
而我宁愿把一生的激情
都浪费在色彩变暗的山下
守着一块墓碑——我在这里

at the foot of the hill

From darkness to brightness， if staring at it from the short range
You would understand that those sunflowers raising their heads
Actually don’t need any sunshine. Because of appointment of a grass
They are not missing， along the road you must pass by in June

Who can tell me that everything here has been tried
The steps towards the jungle bent the garret of the sky
Become a way to climb up
But it is there， in your glance

Like the door full of fear of light
You appearance shows the stream in the span of the bridge
With a complete paragraph， no need to turn around
The misty river doesn’t take the rosy clouds across the city

You must admit that the morning bell and drums forgot the city
A breeze， fingers of cotton let the mountain of jungle
Get a glass heart
Every time I approach， I always see the deities of the mountains

Silence， shout or answer
Continue growing in the soil under the mountain
Phoebe zhennan refused to copy the scream of pain of thorns
But unable to get rid of the deadly request from palace
Only because of caves， there remains the practice of the mountains
These addicts do not need to climb up to the mountain
A faint scent and a moon can make them
Stop disease of your body on a halfway

The people of a city are proud of this mountain
And I would prefer to have the passion for life
Wasted under the mountain where color dilutes
Guarding a tombstone —— I’m here
