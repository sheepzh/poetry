title:初夏的湖州
date:20170202

沉底为泥沙，白纱漂净
飞扬乱草；软的，油乎乎，
当人人背影出现幼虫的一刻，
喳喳叫，迎面来的鸟鸣
没有来源。

这里初夏夸大气候，
熟悉不适合，似曾相识极为精确。

不详蠕动扩大到抽象（我们的语音），
我们脱口而出说宇宙，
说神，说死；
以至于说出的话都是自己不知道的；
一边继续蠕动抽象的脊梁。

在白纱后面，
确切地说，
只贴着布的一面，
反过来，黛青砖块滑落；
随着白雨和丝扭捏，永不着地。

"And Humming Drafts Keep Drawing"

And humming drafts keep drawing
dramatically from all directions
as the color red， no white，
no gray， no，no scarlet，

as the people flapping showing what they have left there
and trying to be in a very broad
air channel， with streaming through above
only a mind of the falling at the moment，

get to the face， to the deep， to be mid，
to be around， to be
spread， to be forced to get back to the mid， many times；

To the huge blue turning against the unknown，
against a tiny beaming room，
for the simple matter， days are faint
in a yellow transparency of the absolute；

To the smearing images from colorful verity where holy
hairs bringing a brown person just below
as a common into an
outdoor fresh-air phenomenon
of graphically narrow white features；

so that there three shadows， one quite small，
the other even much smaller， are mostly seen
in a hollow gateway which leaks some waters
when the bigger keeps
a case containing melted heavy metal.

What scratchs and caves on the solid
extremely thin water film with subtle dark iron worms
sounds just hummings
moving around with no appearance but jade-temperature characters，
with most baby's crying mostly
even with brightness. Brighter than some secret slogans
of the traditional.
Most of them are just true double images
and for this reason， they can continuously
seep heavy and deep breathing into the vast above.

And as the familiar is acting vesperal remembered puppet of dreams，
the day is to explain a kind of softness without shadow
which used to enjoy the dark， the feel of it on eyes，
and on faces， the smell has a smell， it could never quite explain
that has brought from the stepping sound， after a long blank motion；

and then as it looks persistently containing itself
for the invisibility of air and a pane of glass， and a color of smell；
from the near， a valley in a flourished wood，

and the big birds there， just one small， crow over the vanity of calling
on the way of the direction they fly on， of a short door on the height，
of a thin in the front， a time getting late， again a hint in the middle，
in
a drop.
